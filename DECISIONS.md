---

### ADR-1 · 2026-10-02 · accepted — Territory = authoritative cell raster + resolution-independent rendering
**Decision.** The sim owns a cell grid (owner, controller, terrain, province, flags). Rendering
draws it with smooth shader borders, a fine coastline mask and procedural detail tiles.
It never shows blocky cells.
**Why.** AoC's charm comes from per-pixel fronts (VISUAL: reference screenshots), and a
raster keeps the editor (brush/bucket/line), map import and frontier processing simple and
fast. Vector provinces would lose the organic fronts. A pure raster would fail the
"no blocky zoom" rule, so the render layer adds resolution independence.
**Consequences.** Cosmetic border displacement is bounded below 0.5 cell, so render
and sim never disagree on ownership. Sim cost scales with the frontier, not grid
area. The default size is M (2048×1024), which is about 20× AoC's land tile count.

### ADR-2 · 2026-10-02 · accepted — Worker-authoritative sim; snapshots with interest management
**Decision.** The pure `src/sim` runs in a Web Worker (and in Node). Main sends commands and
viewport subscriptions and gets rAF-acked transferable snapshots. Subscriptions change only
what is sent.
**Why.** Keeps the UI at 60 fps regardless of sim load, gives one code path for tests,
soak and critic runs, and lets the tactical tier get rich element data without paying for the
whole world.
**Consequences.** Invariant I4 (hash unchanged under viewport churn) is a permanent
test. Lint rules forbid render/ui imports in sim.

### ADR-3 · 2026-10-02 · accepted — Formations → elements → individuals, combat at element level everywhere
**Decision.** Elements (unit proxies of N men, vehicles, ships or planes) are authoritative sim
entities, and combat resolves per element in every battle whether viewed or not. Slotted
element poses and sortie paths are "derived kinematics" (pure functions of state).
The close tier expands elements into individuals, with the count equal to strength.
**Why.** This is the only way to satisfy "same state drives every tier" and "casualties at
tactical zoom change strength at strategic zoom" without view-dependent simulation,
which would break determinism.
**Consequences.** Bounded cost: element combat only inside battles (about 20–40k engaged
elements worst case). Individual positions within an element footprint are
presentational, and this is documented in SPEC §8.

### ADR-4 · 2026-10-02 · accepted (finalised in PLAN 0.15) — LOD tiers & render stack: raw WebGL2 + twgl.js
**Decision.**
- Four tiers T0–T3 over continuous zoom, with opacity curves and hysteresis.
- Render stack: **raw WebGL2 + twgl.js** (MIT); PixiJS is not used at runtime.
- Map: one full-screen pass over R16UI owner/controller textures with cubic B-spline indicator
  smoothing (`src/render/map`).
- Units: one instanced draw per atlas with GPU prev→cur interpolation (`src/render/units`).
- Camera-relative f32 coordinates: integer origin + f32 offsets, with the camera offset computed in f64.

**Why.** Measured with `npm run bench` on 2026-10-02 (`docs/bench/*.json`). Setup: RTX 4070 Ti, ANGLE/D3D11,
1920×1080, vsync off, GPU time from EXT_disjoint_timer_query_webgl2. Pixi rows use a ParticleContainer
(Pixi's fastest path) with CPU interpolation; the map in the Pixi scene is a pre-rendered texture.

| case | stack | uncapped fps | CPU ms/frame p50 / p95 | GPU ms/frame | GPU ms units only |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T0 map, 150 nations | raw | ~5000 | ≈0 | 0.43–0.46 | — |
| 10k proxies + map | raw | 2957 | 0.00 / 0.10 | 0.41 | 0.016 |
| 30k proxies + map | raw | 2487 | 0.00 / 0.10 | 0.47 | 0.059 |
| 10k proxies + map sprite | Pixi 8.22 | 2336 | 0.20 / 1.10 | 0.12 | ≈0.07 (frame − sprite) |
| 30k proxies + map sprite | Pixi 8.22 | 1412 | 0.40 / 1.40 | 0.32 | ≈0.27 (frame − sprite) |

- Raw instancing with GPU interpolation draws 30k proxies in about 0.06 ms GPU and ~0 ms per-frame CPU.
  Pixi needs CPU interpolation every frame: 0.4–1.4 ms at 30k on this CPU, likely 1–4 ms on a laptop, which
  is a large part of the 6 ms main-thread budget. It also spends about 4× more GPU time on the same sprites.
- The map must use custom integer-texture shaders anyway. In Pixi that means custom Mesh/Shader code with no
  benefit from the library.
- twgl adds only thin helpers (uniform setting, program and texture creation), so we keep full control.

**Budget translation (mid-range laptop).** A mid-range laptop iGPU (e.g. Iris Xe) is roughly 15–20× slower
than the dev GPU. Dev-GPU guards, checked by `npm run bench` in Phase 7:
- T0 full frame ≤ 1.0 ms GPU at 1080p (now 0.46);
- T2 frame with 10k proxies ≤ 2.0 ms GPU (now 0.41);
- per-frame main-thread CPU ≤ 1 ms with 30k proxies (now ≈ 0.1 p95).

Uncapped fps on the dev machine is recorded but is not the budget metric.

**Consequences.**
- Map modes, occupation hatching and borders live in GLSL.
- Instance buffers are refilled once per snapshot: 1.2 ms for 30k proxies on the main thread. Phase 2 moves
  the fill into the worker's snapshot builder (the instance layout becomes part of `shared/protocol`).
- `pixi.js` stays a devDependency only for the BP benchmark page.

### ADR-5 · 2026-10-02 · accepted — 1 tick = 1 sim hour; f64 + dmath + PCG32 determinism
**Decision.** Fixed 1 h tick with staggered AI and daily/monthly subsystems. Fire events carry
a subtick for smooth tactical animation. f64 using only exactly-specified ops,
custom trig/exp, per-subsystem RNG streams and a counter-based hash for order-independent draws.
**Why.** An hour is fine enough for movement and combat to look continuous when
interpolated, yet coarse enough that 30 sim-years (263k ticks) fit the soak and sweep
budget. `Math.sin` etc. are not guaranteed bit-identical across engines. Fixed-point
was considered and rejected as slower to write, with no benefit given the restricted op set.
**Consequences.** ESLint bans nondeterministic APIs in `src/sim`. Golden-value tests run
in both Node and Chromium.

### ADR-6 · 2026-10-02 · accepted — No SharedArrayBuffer
**Why.** Static hosts (itch.io, GitHub Pages) cannot reliably set COOP/COEP headers.
Transferable buffers with a recycled pool give equivalent throughput at our snapshot
sizes.

### ADR-7 · 2026-10-02 · accepted (crop refined in PLAN 0.18) — Miller cylindrical projection, cropped 80°N–64.165°S, per-row scale tables **[AoC-DEVIATION]**
**Refinement (PLAN 0.18).** The southern crop is 64.165°S instead of ~60°S. This makes the projected extent
exactly 2π × π, so every map size is W = 2H with square cells (`src/sim/data/projection.ts`). It also keeps
the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula at the bottom edge.
**Why.** A familiar world shape, a simple wrap for the looping map, and correct km-based
speeds and blast radii via `kx/ky[y]`. Antarctica is excluded by default (it adds no
gameplay). AoC appears to use an equirectangular-like stretch (VISUAL, low confidence).

### ADR-8 · 2026-10-02 · accepted — 1938 borders from Natural Earth admin-0/1 + hand assignment
**Why.** No permissive 1938 dataset was found: CShapes 2.0 is CC BY-NC-SA (non-commercial),
and aourednik/historical-basemaps is GPL-3.0 (copyleft would spread to the project's data).
Natural Earth is public domain. Admin-1 is assigned to 1938 owners, with hand-drawn
polylines where interwar borders split admin-1 units.
**Consequences.** Some border segments are approximations. The polylines are listed in
DATA_SOURCES as our own work.

### ADR-9 · 2026-10-02 · accepted — Binary gzip saves; JSON+RLE scenario files; IndexedDB autosave
**Why.** Typed-array sections give a bit-identical round trip and fast load.
`CompressionStream` exists in both browsers and Node 18+. Scenario files stay
human-inspectable and shareable.

### ADR-10 · 2026-10-02 · accepted — Own flag artwork; 1938 Germany uses the black-white-red tricolour **[AoC-DEVIATION]**
**Why.** All flags are drawn as our own SVG specs, so no third-party art is used. A
swastika flag is legally restricted in several jurisdictions (e.g. §86a StGB) and would
complicate static hosting and storefronts. The 1933–35 state tricolour is historically
grounded and recognisable. The flag editor lets users change it in their scenarios.

### ADR-11 · 2026-10-02 · accepted — DOM UI with Preact + signals over the canvas
**Why.** Built-in i18n, text layout, accessibility and UI-size scaling (`rem`) come for
free. Panels update at low frequency, so DOM cost is negligible. The canvas is reserved
for the map and units.

### ADR-12 · 2026-10-02 · accepted — TypeScript pinned to 6.0; local module-boundary lint rule
**Decision.** Pin `typescript` to `~6.0` (was 7.0.2). Enforce SPEC §2.1 layers with a local
ESLint rule (`warsim/module-boundaries`) instead of `import-x/no-restricted-paths`.
**Why.** TypeScript 7 is the native (Go) compiler and ships no JS API; typescript-eslint
8.71 requires `typescript >=4.8.4 <6.1.0`. 6.0 is the last JS-API release with the same
language semantics, so `tsc -b` and ESLint share one compiler. `import-x` resolves imports
through the filesystem, so it cannot check fixture files linted at virtual paths or imports
of modules that don't exist yet; a lexical resolver is about 100 lines, has no native
dependency (`unrs-resolver`) and also lets the sim have a package allowlist (`zod` only).
**Consequences.** Revisit when typescript-eslint supports TS 7 (it can then move to the
native compiler). The rule does not follow path aliases; none are used (relative imports only).

### ADR-13 · 2026-10-02 · accepted — Shipped map-asset budget and elevation codec
**Decision.**
- `npm run data` produces assets that are committed under `public/data/earth/`, so a fresh clone builds and
  runs offline: the 16384×8192 land mask (0.38 MB), elevation at 2048×1024, 1024×512 and 512×256
  (2.9 MB total), and admin-1 geometry (3.1 MB, exact NE vertices quantised to 2⁻²⁰) + metadata (0.13 MB).
  Total ≈ 6.5 MB.
- Shipped files use a neutral `.wsz` extension (gzip payload): static servers, including `vite preview`,
  add `Content-Encoding: gzip` to `.gz` files, so `fetch` would return decompressed bytes and the sha256
  check would fail.
- Admin-1 geometry is not simplified: independent per-polygon simplification would open gaps and overlaps
  along shared borders, while exact shared vertices rasterize gap-free.
- The 4096×2048 elevation level is a local derived product only (`.cache/data/derived/`, ~8 MB), for
  offline scenario and terrain tools.
- Elevation encoding: gzip(byte-planes(row-delta(int16 m))), with ocean depths quantised to 10 m.
- gzip headers are normalised (mtime 0, OS byte 255) so outputs are byte-identical across platforms. Raw
  sources are pinned by URL tag and sha256 (`tools/data/sources.json`).

**Why.** Raw int16 + gzip was 13.8 MB at 4096 and 3.5 MB at 2048. Delta + byte-planes halves that: elevation
is smooth along rows, and the high byte is almost constant. Coarse bathymetry is enough for sea shading.
A shipped budget of ~5 MB keeps the static site and the repo light. M-size maps (2048×1024) use the 2048
level directly; hillshade at higher zoom adds procedural detail (SPEC §8 T2/T3), so a 4096 level adds little.

**Consequences.** L/XL maps derive terrain from the cached 4096 level offline (scenario build), never at
runtime. Regenerating assets is idempotent (`npm run data -- --check` fails on drift), and
`tests/unit/data-manifest.test.ts` verifies sha256, sizes, known places and pyramid consistency.

### ADR-15 · 2026-10-02 · accepted — Terrain derived from land cover + relief; crossings as data
**Decision.**
- Terrain is derived per cell offline (SPEC §3.2). Sources:
  - land-cover colour from Natural Earth I (NE1_HR_LC, public domain), matched to labelled reference
    sites sampled from the raster itself, so there are no hand-picked RGB values;
  - relief from the ETOPO standard deviation within the cell;
  - marsh from NE wetlands/deltas plus our own outlines of 10 missing major wetlands.
- The land mask now excludes natural lakes (Great Lakes, Ladoga, Victoria, Baikal …).
- Crossings are a data list of 24 real straits (`data/maps/earth/straits.json`), applied at load.

**Deviations from AoC (logged per PROMPT).**
- *Colour terrain view instead of AoC's greyscale editor code.* AoC's editor palette (VISUAL,
  trailer "Create your own"/"Paint scenarios", 2026-10-02): Basic Land, Desert/Tundra, Hills,
  Mountains, Crossing, Water in grey shades. Ours has 12 classes in natural colours. A derived world
  needs more classes (forest, grassland, marsh, ice) to drive SPEC §5 combat and §6 armour, and
  natural colours read better in a terrain mode.
- *Mountains are passable* (move ×2.5 foot / ×4 motor / ×5 tracked, defence ×1.6, armour attack
  ×0.4–0.5), while AoC mountains are impassable (TEXT). The 1938 world's decisive mountain fronts
  (Alps, Caucasus, Apennines, Burma) were fought through. Chokepoints still emerge from the cost.
- *Crossings are real narrow straits only.* AoC's painted crossings can be long bands across seas
  (VISUAL). Longer gaps are for naval transport and amphibious invasion (Phase 4), which AoC lacks.
  The straits list is editable data, so a scenario can add AoC-style lanes.

**Known limits.**
- NE lakes are modern: the Aral Sea and Lake Chad are their shrunken outlines. Reservoirs are
  excluded (mostly post-1938).
- Hand-drawn wetland outlines are coarse, so the Pripyat, Vasyugan and Hudson Bay marshes show
  rounded-box shapes. They can be refined in `tools/data/wetlands.json` without code changes.
- Paris and other large cities read as grassland/plains until PLAN 1.5 makes city cells URBAN.

### ADR-14 · 2026-10-02 · accepted — Data schemas: zod v4, strict objects, one validator for every `data/` file
**Decision.**
- Every JSON file under `data/` has a zod schema in `src/sim/data/schemas.ts`. `DATA_FILES` maps
  path patterns to schemas, and a file under an unknown path fails validation. The sim may import
  `zod` (ADR-2 allowlist).
- Objects are `strictObject`: an unknown key is an error, which catches typos such as `speed` vs `speed_kmh`.
- The cross-file checks that one schema cannot express live in `validateDataSet`:
  - unique ids;
  - references: techReq, prereqs, trait excludes (both ways), scenario map and size;
  - the tech graph is acyclic and prereqs are not later than the tech;
  - the terrain table is in cell-enum order.
- The i18n catalog check (every nameKey/descKey in `en.json`) runs in the test, because the sim may
  not import UI code.
- Errors read `<file>: <path>: <message>`, using zod's own messages.
- Map geometry is data: `data/maps/<id>/map.json` + `data/scenarios/<id>/scenario.json` drive
  `SCENARIO_GEOMETRY` (toy today, earth/1938 from PLAN 1.3). JSON imports in `src/` carry
  `with { type: 'json' }`, because Playwright loads `src/` in plain Node ESM.
- The unit `sprite` field (SPEC §3.6) is deferred to the Phase 2 unit atlas. Under strict schemas it
  must be added to schema and data together.

**Why.** Data-driven design (PROMPT) only works if bad data fails loudly and points at the field. zod
v4 gives typed inference from the same schema, and is pure and deterministic (allowed in the sim).

**Consequences.** All stats in `data/units`, `data/tech` and `data/terrain.json` are first-pass values,
original to this project. Balance is tuned in Phase 3–7 against the SPEC §5 combat model. Starting
tech per nation arrives with the nations file (PLAN 1.4).
