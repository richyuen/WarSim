## Watch list (not blocking)

- `reference/NOTES.md` (the user's taste notes, highest-priority reference) does not exist
  (checked 2026-10-02). Visual/feel decisions rely on `reference/screens/`, the trailer and
  itch/Steam/devlog text, and are marked lower confidence until notes appear.
- The e2e stage depends on machine load: on 2026-10-03 another project's dev server held ~2.5
  cores and the stage took 2.9 min instead of 1.4. The expect timeout is now 15 s.
- Tick time after ADR-47 (2026-10-03): year-1 mean 4.6–5.9 ms on seed 99 against the 1.5 ms
  budget (PLAN 7.1). Hot spots: supply reflood, pathfinding, combat.
